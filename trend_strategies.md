#### Chande Forecast Oscillator Strategy

The [ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy) uses _cfo_ values that are generated by the [ChandeForecastOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChandeForecastOscillator) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _cfo_ is below zero, and SELL action when _cfo_ is above zero.

```golang
actions := indicator.ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy(asset)
```

#### KDJ Strategy

The [KdjStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#KdjStrategy) function uses the _k_, _d_, _j_ values that are generated by the [Kdj](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Kdj) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _k_ crosses above _d_ and _j_. It is stronger when below 20%. Also the SELL action is when _k_ crosses below _d_ and _j_. It is strong when above 80%.

```golang
actions := indicator.KdjStrategy(rPeriod, kPeriod, dPeriod, asset)
```

As the [KdjStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#KdjStrategy) function does not match the [StrategyFunction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StrategyFunction), the [MakeKdjStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MakeKdjStrategy) function takes _rPeriod_, _kPeriod_, _dPeriod_, and provides a strategy function.

```golang
strategy := indicator.MakeKdjStrategy(rPeriod, kPeriod, dPeriod)
actions := strategy(asset)
```

By default, _rPeriod_ of 9, _kPeriod_ of 3, and _dPeriod_ of 3 are used. The [DefaultKdjStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#DefaultKdjStrategy) function can be used with those periods.

```golang
actions := indicator.DefaultKdjStrategy(asset)
```

#### MACD Strategy

The [MacdStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MacdStrategy) uses the _macd_, and _signal_ values that are generated by the [Macd](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Macd) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _macd_ crosses above _signal_, and SELL action when _macd_ crosses below _signal_.

```golang
actions := indicator.MacdStrategy(asset)
```

#### Trend Strategy

The [TrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#TrendStrategy) provides a simply strategy to buy the given asset following the asset's closing value increases in _count_ subsequent rows. Produces the sell action following the asset's closing value decreases in _count_ subsequent rows.

```golang
actions := indicator.TrendStrategy(asset, 4)
```

The function signature of [TrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#TrendStrategy) does not match the [StrategyFunction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StrategyFunction) type, as it requires an additional _count_ parameter. The [MakeTrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MakeTrendStrategy) function can be used to return a [StrategyFunction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StrategyFunction) instance based on the given _count_ value.

```golang
strategy := indicator.MakeTrendStrategy(4)
actions := strategy(asset)
```
