#### Chande Forecast Oscillator Strategy

The [ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy) uses _cfo_ values that are generated by the [ChandeForecastOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChandeForecastOscillator) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _cfo_ is below zero, and SELL action when _cfo_ is above zero.

```golang
actions := indicator.ChandeForecastOscillatorStrategy(asset)
```

#### MACD Strategy

The [MacdStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MacdStrategy) uses the _macd_, and _signal_ values that are generated by the [Macd](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Macd) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _macd_ crosses above _signal_, and SELL action when _macd_ crosses below _signal_.

```golang
actions := indicator.MacdStrategy(asset)
```

#### Trend Strategy

The [TrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#TrendStrategy) provides a simply strategy to buy the given asset following the asset's closing value increases in _count_ subsequent rows. Produces the sell action following the asset's closing value decreases in _count_ subsequent rows.

```golang
actions := indicator.TrendStrategy(asset, 4)
```

The function signature of [TrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#TrendStrategy) does not match the [StrategyFunction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StrategyFunction) type, as it requires an additional _count_ parameter. The [MakeTrendStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MakeTrendStrategy) function can be used to return a [StrategyFunction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StrategyFunction) instance based on the given _count_ value.

```golang
strategy := indicator.MakeTrendStrategy(4)
actions := strategy(asset)
```
