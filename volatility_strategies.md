#### Bollinger Bands Strategy

The [BollingerBandsStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#BollingerBandsStrategy) uses the _upperBand_, and _lowerBand_ values that are generated by the [BollingerBands](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#BollingerBands) indicator function to provide a SELL action when the asset's closing is above the _upperBand_, and a BUY action when the asset's closing is below the _lowerBand_ values.

```golang
actions := indicator.BollingerBandsStrategy(asset)
```

#### Projection Oscillator Strategy

The [ProjectionOscillatorStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ProjectionOscillatorStrategy) uses _po_ and _spo_ values that are generated by the [ProjectionOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ProjectionOscillator) indicator function to provide a BUY action when _po_ is above _spo_, and SELL action when _po_ is below _spo_.

```golang
actions := indicator.ProjectionOscillatorStrategy(period, smooth, asset)
```
