#### MACD and RSI Strategy

The [MacdAndRsiStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MacdAndRsiStrategy) function uses the actions generated by the [MacdStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#MacdStrategy) and the [DefaultRsiStrategy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#DefaultRsiStrategy) to provide BUY and SELL actions.

```golang
actions := indicator.MacdAndRsiStrategy(asset)
```
