# Specification: Connors RSI\n\n## Overview\nConnors RSI (CRSI) is a momentum indicator developed by Larry Connors that combines three components to provide a more reliable indicator of short-term price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is primarily used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.\n\n## Components\n- **RSI (3):** Standard Relative Strength Index over a 3-period window.\n- **Streak RSI (2):** Relative Strength Index of the "up/down streak" over a 2-period window. A streak is the number of consecutive days the price has closed higher (positive) or lower (negative) than the previous day.\n- **Percent Rank (100):** The percentage of price changes over the last 100 periods that are lower than the current period's price change.\n\n## Indicator Logic\n- **Calculation:** `CRSI = (RSI(3) + StreakRSI(2) + PercentRank(100)) / 3`\n- **Generic Stream:** Operates on any numeric data stream (Go channels).\n- **Default Periods:** Standard (3, 2, 100) periods will be supported by default.\n\n## Strategy Logic\n- **Buy Signal:** Generate a BUY action when CRSI crosses below an oversold threshold (e.g., 10).\n- **Sell Signal:** Generate a SELL action when CRSI crosses above an overbought threshold (e.g., 90).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Connors RSI indicator implemented in the `momentum` package.\n- [ ] Connors RSI strategy implemented in the `strategy/momentum` package.\n- [ ] High code coverage (>90%) for both indicator and strategy.\n- [ ] Backtesting report generation for the CRSI strategy.\n- [ ] Data-driven unit tests using CSV test data.
