#### Awesome Oscillator

The [AwesomeOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#AwesomeOscillator) function calculates the awesome oscillator based on low and high daily prices for a given stock. It is an indicator used to measure market momentum.

```
Median Price = ((Low + High) / 2)
AO = 5-Period SMA - 34-Period SMA.
```

```Golang
result := indicator.AwesomeOscillator(low, high)
```

#### Chaikin Oscillator

The [ChaikinOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#ChaikinOscillator) function measures the momentum of the [Accumulation/Distribution (A/D)](volume_indicators.md#accumulationdistribution-ad) using the [Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)](trend_indicators.md#moving-average-convergence-divergence-macd) formula. It takes the difference between fast and slow periods EMA of the A/D. Cross above the A/D line indicates bullish.

```
CO = Ema(fastPeriod, AD) - Ema(slowPeriod, AD)
```

```Golang
co, ad := indicator.ChaikinOscillator(fastPeriod, slowPeriod, high, low, closing)
```

Most frequently used fast and short periods are 3 and 10. The [DefaultChaikinOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#DefaultChaikinOscillator) function calculates Chaikin Oscillator with those periods.

#### Ichimoku Cloud

The [IchimokuCloud](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#IchimokuCloud), also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, calculates a versatile indicator that defines support and resistence, identifies tred direction, gauges momentum, and provides trading signals.

```
Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line) = (9-Period High + 9-Period Low) / 2
Kijun-sen (Base Line) = (26-Period High + 26-Period Low) / 2
Senkou Span A (Leading Span A) = (Conversion Line + Base Line) / 2
Senkou Span B (Leading Span B) = (52-Period High + 52-Period Low) / 2
Chikou Span (Lagging Span) = Closing plotted 26 days in the past.
```

```Golang
conversionLine, baseLine, leadingSpanA, leadingSpanB, laggingLine := indicator.IchimokuCloud(high, low, closing)
```

#### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The [Rsi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Rsi) function calculates a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought and oversold conditions.

```
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
```

```Golang
rs, rsi := indicator.Rsi(closing)
```

#### Stochastic Oscillator

The [StochasticOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#StochasticOscillator) function calculates a momentum indicator that shows the location of the closing relative to high-low range over a set number of periods.

```
K = (Closing - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
D = 3-Period SMA of K
```

```Golang
k, d := indicator.StochasticOscillator(high, low, closing)
```

#### Williams R

The [WilliamsR](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#WilliamsR) function calculates the Williams R based on low, high, and closing prices. It is a type of momentum indicator that moves between 0 and -100 and measures overbought and oversold levels.

```
WR = (Highest High - Closing) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)
```

```Golang
result := indicator.WilliamsR(low, high, closing)
```
